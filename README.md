# Giphy-Project

The goal of this project is to create an app that links to the Giphy API and pulls in images based on button clicks and user input. When the user clicks on one of the ten pre-made buttons a keyword will link to the Giphy directory and automatically generate still images. Once clicked, these still images will animate, and return to still when clicked again. The user can submit their own favorite comedy show to generate a new button which connects to Giphy like the others. See how many classic TV comedies you can generate!
